      <h2>an exploration of myself</h2>
      <h3>12 September 2020</h3>
      <hr>
      <p>I found it difficult to nail down my core values. I consider myself and all people to be evolving and multifaceted, so what my values are today might be different by tomorrow. However after thinking a lot about what I admire in other people I started to distill a set of values that I could call my core values. For the sake of this exercise lets boil myself down to these following umbrella words – curiosity, courage, love, pleasure, and accountability.</p>
      <h3>Curiosity</h3>
      <p>I feel that most of my identity rests in this value and my willingness to explore ideas and learn. I want to know anything and everything. I love research.</p>
      <h3>Courage</h3>  
      <p>Courage can mean a lot of things, but I see it generally as the rejection of fear, big or small.  Fear can be a tool your mind uses to keep yourself alive, but it can also keep a person from achieving their goals. This is a value I do not always embody but is one that is important to me and I feel has lead me to New Zealand, through a residency application, through multiple career shifts, and here to this course.</p>
      <h3>Love</h3>
      <p>I take this one to mean a spectrum of values as well. Kindness, empathy, compassion – I believe these all fall under the umbrella of love. It is important to me to exhibit the qualities of love as much as I can and in every situation, whatever I am doing.</p>
      <h3>Pleasure</h3>
      <p>Finding enjoyment and satisfaction in how we spend our brief time on this planet is so important to me. All my other values are important to me but finding pleasure through all of them is the reward and, rewards are tremendously valuable. No matter what I am doing I try to find enjoyment and pleasure in it.</p>
      <h3>Accountability</h3>
      <p>This value encompasses reliability, responsibility, dependability, loyalty, honesty, and integrity. I have wrapped all these values up into one word as they are all equally important to me. My own self esteem as well as how I view others is closely related to how they embody this list of values I have embedded in this one word, accountability. If I exhibit these values in what I do I am satisfied, whatever the outcome may be. I highly value and and try to surround myself with people who exhibit the qualities of accountability.</p>
      <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
      <p>An everyday example of making values based decisions are the decisions we all make as consumers every day. I understand the role I play as a consumer and the impact it has on the world and others, so I strive to make the most ethical consumer decisions whether it is buying food, clothing, electronics, etc. Lets take food as a specific example and lets say the decision to purchase certified organic free trade coffee vs conventional coffee. The values I weigh in this decision are accountability and kindness. It is important to me that the farmers who grew the coffee were treated and paid fairly. It is also important to me that the earth was well looked after when growing this crop. Purchasing an organic fair trade certified product ensures accountability and reassures me that the growers and the earth were treated kindly.</p>
      <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <p>I grew up in Midwestern America so my local culture valued self reliance, simplicity and hard work. These values have informed everything I do. In every job I have I strive to be the hardest working member of the team. I derive a lot of pleasure and self worth from working hard, whatever it may be I am working on. I also consider myself a minimalist. I find joy in simplicity. Self reliance is important to me and I always work towards this as a goal. Whether it be in a career or in my personal life, I value learning how to do something and being able to do it for myself. When I consider my identity I give a lot of weight to the practices of working hard, living a simple life, and always striving to improve my knowledge base and skills.</p>
      <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development.</h2>
      <p>I recently took a Gallup Clifton Strengths assessment which breaks down your strengths and limitations into 34 of what they call ‘Strength Themes’. This assessment heavily influenced my answers to this section. Below is a list of my top ten strength themes.</p>
      <hr>
      <h3>1. Input</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to collect and archive all kinds of information.</p>
      <h3>2. Adaptability</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Adaptability theme prefer to “go with the flow.” They tend to be “now” people who take things as they come and discover the future one day at a time.</p>
      <h3>3. Learner</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to
        continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</p>
      <h3>4. Intellection</h3>
        <P>People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterised by their intellectual activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.</p>
      <h3>5. Responsibility</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Responsibility theme take psychological ownership of what they say they will do. They are committed to stable values such as honesty and loyalty.</p>
      <h3>6. Empathy</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Empathy theme can sense the feelings of other people by
        imagining themselves in others' lives or others' situations.</p>        
      <h3>7. Achiever</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Achiever theme have a great deal of stamina and work
        hard. They take great satisfaction from being busy and productive.</p>
      <h3>8. Command</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Command theme have presence. They can take control of
        a situation and make decisions.</p>
      <h3>9. Developer</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Developer theme recognise and cultivate the potential in
        others. They spot the signs of each small improvement and derive satisfaction from these
        improvements.</p>
      <h3>10. Connectedness</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Connectedness theme have faith in the links between all
        things. They believe there are few coincidences and that almost every event has a reason.</p>
      <hr>  
      <h3>My limitations, or the strength themes I scored lowest in and were at the bottom of the list, are as follows.</h3>        
      <h3>30. Woo</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Woo theme love the challenge of meeting new people and winning them over. They derive satisfaction from breaking the ice and making a connection with another person.</p>
      <h3>31. Analytical</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.</p>
      <h3>32. Focus</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through, and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritise, then act.</p>
      <h3>33. Discipline</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Discipline theme enjoy routine and structure. Their world is best described by the order they create.</p>
      <h3>34. Context</h3>
      <p>People who are especially talented in the Context theme enjoy thinking about the past. They understand the present by researching its history.</p>
      <hr> 
      <p>This collection of strength and limitations makes perfect sense to me as I am definitely a collector of information and I never cease educating myself. My first 5 strengths inform my drive to learn and the next five strengths inform my natural desire to lead and guide people toward a shared goal. In the context of the Gallup Clifton Strengths assessment, most of my top strength themes landed in 2 categories they call Strategic Thinking and Relationship Building. In all my jobs over the years I focused on and found the most satisfaction from these two aforementioned activities.</p> 
      <p>My limitations, or the bottom 5 strength themes, explain some of the lack of direction I have experienced in my life. I sometimes lack discipline and focus. I think I changed my major at Uni 6 times. Because I find so many different topics and ideas interesting I am easily distracted when working or studying. My attention is easily grabbed by whatever pops up in front of me and even when I am trying hard to focus on  one subject, my mind is also working in the background coming up with other subjects I could be focusing on. I also tend to throw myself into projects without a clear plan which is another example of a lack of focus. I just charge ahead and make the plan on the fly which can lead to messy work and mistakes, something I will need to work on during this course.</p>  
      <h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
      <p>My top 5 strengths will certainly be useful in the context of this learning journey. Input, Learner and Itellection are all about consuming information, thinking and learning. The Adaptability and Responsibility strengths with help me to persevere when I inevitably run into obstacles.</p>
      
      <h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2>
      <p>When I was managing a supermarket I experienced a time when I didn’t agree with the produce manager on a pricing structure for fresh produce. I told him to change the prices of some of the produce but he resisted these price changes and did not agree with my strategy. My initial approach to him was very abrupt and authoritative, which was met with tension and resistance. I let it go in that instance and we kept the prices the same. I knew I had to come up with a new approach to effectively manage my produce manager and get my desired outcome. My new approach: research, dialog, collaboration.</p> 
      <p>First I did my research and analysis so I had solid information backing my price structure. Then I approached him and asked him to explain why he priced certain produce the way he did. I listened without interrupting. I then validated his opinion without agreeing with it by saying I understood why he was thinking that way. I went on to explain my pricing strategy and didn’t simply tell him that's what I wanted, but also why I wanted it that way with clearly articulated supporting evidence. Initially I had just told him to change the prices to what I wanted and he resisted and complained. Once I created a dialog around the issue and explained my reasoning he saw the value in my decision and agreed with me.</p> 
      <p>Through having solid information to back my strategy and creating a dialogue in which I shared this information with him it became a collaboration instead of me just giving orders and meeting resistance.</p>
