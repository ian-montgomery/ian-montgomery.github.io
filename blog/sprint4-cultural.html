        <h2>nueroplasticity and growth mindset</h2>

        <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <p>
            The brain is plastic. This means it can grow and change over time through repetition and practice. When you understand this fact it means you are not beholden to what you think are “natural” abilities but actually have agency in your brain and what it can do. If you understand that you can change your brain, then you can change your brain!
        </p>
        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, when you understand that your brain can change then it empowers you to take control of your brains development. In my case, I am someone who is studying computer programming in my mid-thirties. If I was not aware of neuroplasticity I might think that it is too late for someone like me to learn something as complex as computer programming. However, I am aware of neuroplasticity so I am going to use that knowledge to my benefit and practice coding every single day until I have created and strengthened those neural pathways. 
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Repetition and practice. If you perform an activity over and over again, the pathways in your brain that fire up while you are performing that activity will strengthen from use over time, much like any other muscle in you body. So practising a variety of activities, such as coding, playing an instrument, writing with your non-dominant hand, etc. will increase the connections in your brain required to do these things. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Exposing yourself to new experiences will increase your neuroplasticity. A study done on London cabbies and bus drivers showed that the cabbies had more neural connections simply because they had to go to a variety of places and drive many different routes each day, where as bus drivers drove the same route every day. Taking different routes or doing a variety of different activities or experiencing a complex range of stimuli will all help in general neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <p>
            And finally, simply having a growth mindset will help. Just believing that your brain can change will help change your brain.

        <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
        <hr>
        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
        <p>
            Growth mindset is the belief that the brain can grow and is not a ‘fixed’ entity. When someone holds a fixed mindset they may think that they could never be a computer programmer as they do not know how to be a computer programmer and computer activities may come hard to them. A growth mindset is the belief that even though you do not know how to be a computer programmer, through work and perseverance you can grow that knowledge and skill set. This is of course enormously relevant when it comes to any kind of learning activity. Having a growth mindset will help provide the students in the EDA program the tenacity to carry on in the face of challenges presented by learning computer programming in 15 weeks.
        </p>
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        <p>
            In all honesty nothing surprised me or changed for me in this exploration as these concepts are pretty well known and understood at this point. However it was good to reacquaint myself with the ideas of growth mindset, especially given my struggles recently with learning JavaScript. It would be easy for me to think that my 34 year old brain is to fixed in its ways to learn JavaScript. So reading a bunch of resources on the positive benefits of Growth Mindset has reiterated to me what I knew when I started this course, which is that it is never too late to learn.
        </p>    
        <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
            Growth Mindset will be at the centre of my learning journey. As I have already mentioned a few times, coming into this program I had to be very much in the Growth Mindset so I would not talk myself out of doing it. There are some difficult concepts to learn in the program and I have already had a fair share of struggling to understand JavaScript. It would be easy to adopt a fixed mindset when I run into learning blocks and think it’s too late for me to learn these things. So everyday I need to intentionally practice the Growth Mindset and tell myself that even if I do not understand it today, if I keep working at it I will understand it someday.
