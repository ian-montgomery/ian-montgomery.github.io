      <h2>so how are we going to do this?</h2>
      <h3>12 September 2020</h3>
      <hr>    
      <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>I would like to be have a skill that allows me to work anywhere in the world doing a wide variety of things for a wider variety of organisations. I want a trade that provides a stable income but also freedom to mover about the world. Since programming primarily takes place on a laptop it affords one the luxury of working wherever their laptop happens to be. I do not yet know what “work” will look like for me, but I do know that I would love to get a job with a tech company based in NZ and preferably with a bend towards ethical and sustainable business.</p>
      <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
      <p>Online communication is an area I feel I need further development. I have never really been one to engage in social media or message boards. Using Slack the last couple weeks has really shown me how useful and positive engaging online with your peers can be. I still have a level of discomfort and bashfulness around Slack so I am hoping that through this course I gain enough confidence to engage more with the EDA community online as well as the wider online world. I have always struggled to reach out to my peers for help and I am hoping that through this experience I will get over that fear.</p> 
      <p>I would also like to develop better organisational and time management skills. I have always worked in fast paced, just get it done, does not matter if it is a little messy kind of environment. I am really interested in exploring my personal work habits in an industry like computer programming where the demands are not necessarily as immediate and obviously in my face. These first 5 weeks of self directed learning in the foundations course is the perfect example of the kind of scenario I would like to get better at dealing with – having a defined amount of work but relying on only myself to direct and organise the completion of that work.</p> 
      <p>Finally I am really interested in learning non-violent communication skills in a tech and programming premise. Again, I have worked jobs where less collaboration and more dictation was the norm. I am excited to work in a field where collaboration not only exists but is enthusiastically encouraged. Specifically the part of the collaborative work environment I am hoping to develop further is the ability to give and receive feedback constructively and compassionately.</p> 
      <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations.</h2>
      <p>My strengths probably lie in my ability to learn new skills and understand concepts quickly. My brain is like a sponge and I absolutely devour information. I love learning. I am also determined and willing to put in the long hours to achieve my goals so I would consider work ethic a strength as well.</p> 
      <p>My limitations are probably my mild dyslexia and my own self doubt. I often find that I will learn a skill or a concept but then not believe that I have actually done so. I doubt myself and I criticise myself to the point where it sometimes prevents me from even starting on a project. As they say, I am my own worst critic.</p>
      <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and sustainably with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
      <p>I hold myself to a high standard and take my education as well as this programme seriously. I am not here to waist mine or anyone's time. We are all here to facilitate learning whether it be as a student, teacher, or industry professionals. We all share the same goal and I am here to honor that goal by doing the work, on time, to the best of my ability, and to support my colleagues to do the same.</p> 
      <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
      <p>So far my method has been to first google, then reach out to my facilitator. One of the things I am hoping to improve on during this course is reaching out to my peers for help. I tend to isolate myself in my problems and frustrations so I am committed to getting better at utilising the vibrant community out there who are happy and willing to help.</p>
      <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h2>
      <p>Guidance, availability and feedback. I expect my facilitator to guide me in the right direction when appropriate, be reasonably available for when I need help and to answer questions, and to provide feedback when it is constructive or necessary to do so.</p> 
      <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</h2>
      <p>I have completely cleared my schedule to do this course!</p>
