        <h2>A Time I Got Blocked on a Simple Problem</h2>
        <p>
            During the JavaScript katas in Sprint 4 I got blocked on every single problem, simple or otherwise! 
        </p>
        <p>
          A kata is in nature a simple problem you have to solve as an exercise to build brain muscle memory. You are presented with a small and fairly simple problem that you must solve using code. Well during this week's Sprint, I got stuck and pretty heavily blocked on every single one of these katas. There wasn't one where I breesed right through it effortlessly...until the very last one.   
        </p>
        <p>
          The first kata that really gave me a serious block for hours was one in which I was meant to write a Fizz Buzz, although this one was called a Super Fizz Buzz. A 'fizz buzz' is a simple exercie where you write code to count from 1 to 100 but replace all multiples of 3 with the work 'fizz', all multiples of 5 with the word 'buzz' and all multiples of 15 with the word 'fizzbuzz'. Simple enough. Well I banged my head up against this one for hours. I wrote pseudocode. I tried googling for help. I reached out to my colleagues and my course coordinator. I spent long pensive moments staring at a wall simply trying to will the solution into my brain. Nothing seemed to work. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I became very frustrated and started to think I could never be a programmer if this stupid simple problem was getting the best of me. It was the first time in my experience with this course that I really felt like I could not do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I eventually just had to take a break from this kata and go to bed planning to return to it with fresh eyes and a rested mind. The next morning I came back to the kata and still had no success. I thought surely I will never get this. Finally one of the folks in my cohort reached out to me and offered help. They did an excellent job of leading me through the thought process without giving me the answer. As it turned out, I was overcomplicating the whole process. I was misunderstanding the question and thought I had to do more than I needed. My colleague pointed this out and then gave me a gentle nudge in the right direction. Once this occured I immediately saw what I was doing wrong and solved the problem in a couple minutes. 
        </p>
        <p>
          What I learned from this was a few things. First, it is okay to reach out to my colleagues. They are happy and willing to help in a constructive ways. I also learned that I need to really break the problems down into mananagable pieces and not overcomplicate it. I have a tendency to think the problems are more complicated than they are. And finally, I learned that even though a problem may seem impossible to me in one moment, if I persevere and practice a growth mindset, the problem will eventually seem simple to me in hindsight. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the only problem I managed to solve elegantly was the very last kata in this sprint. In this problem I had to write some code that took the sentence 'Help! buzz I'm buzz buzz surrounded buzz by buzz buzz bees!' and printed it without any of the 'buzz' words so that it read 'Help! I'm surrounded by bees!'
        </p>
        <p>
          I learned through my previous struggles that the best way to get started is to simplify the problem. I started this kata by writing out as much pseudocode as I could think of. I broke down the problem into as many differnt steps as possible so I had many small problems to solve instead of one big one. I then read though each line of my pseudocode and wrote the bit of code that I thought would do that one thing, and so on. By the end of it I had what looked like a working function. I hit the run button to test my code, fully thinking that I would recevie some error messages. To my absolute suprise and joy, the code passed all the tests. I was stunned. What a relief!
        </p>
        <p>
          What worked for me in this case was reading through the problem carefully so that I understood what actions were required and what bits of JavaScript I would need to use. I then Googled each aspect of the problem and read through resources so that I fully understood what each bit of code I needed to use actually did. I then broke the problem down and only focused on writing each different bit of code before I worried about if each piece fit together. Then once I had written the different pieces I refactored my code to ensure that they would all work together. And it worked! I don't know if this was best practice but it worked for me and felt pretty elegant when I ran the code and did not receive any errors.
