      <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognise and manage ones own emotions. It is also the ability to recognise these emotions in other people. Cultivating high emotional intelligence will allow you to understand your emotions as well as those around you, which will in turn allow you to manage the those emotions in yourself and others. Being emotionally intelligent also means you are aware of what triggers your emotions and how they affect you or other people.</p>  
      <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
      <p>IQ, or intelligence quotient, is a measure of a personâ€™s ability to reason using information and logic. It deals in areas like problem solving, memory, and the ability to make predictions based on patterns. Logic and puzzles do not necessarily come into play when considering emotional intelligence. EI is not about how well you can solve a puzzle or predict a pattern, it is about how well you can recognise and manage emotions in yourself and others. IQ could help you solve a puzzle but EI will help you overcome frustration when solving the puzzle or help you effectively solve the puzzle as part of a team.</p>
      <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is important as it gives you the tools you need to prevent yourself from becoming a prisoner of your own emotions. If you learn to understand and manager your emotions then you will not be controlled by them. It also allows you better understanding of people around you and their emotions, ultimately making you a better listener, leader, and collaborator.</p>
