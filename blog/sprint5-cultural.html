        <h2>foundation core skills</h2>
        <h3>6th October 2020</h3>
        <hr>
        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            1. I was not already familiar with the concept of the growth mindset. I have always thought of myself as having natural abilities as well as things I naturally struggled with. I was aware of neuroplasticity but I had never used that understanding to tell myself I could do anything or learning anything. When I was young I took a natural aptitudes test and from then on I focused on my aptitudes and ignored what I understood to be my weaknesses. After doing some extended reading on growth mindset I feel empowered to tell myself a different story about what I am capable of doing or understanding. 
        </p>
        <p>
            2. When working through the personal identity and values core work I discovered that I do not often consciously think about my personal values. I could not easily answer the question of what my core personal values even were. I had to do quite a bit of work and reflection to come up with what I felt represented me and what I value. But through that process I learned what I consider to by my core personal values as well as how much I actually live those values. Who I see myself as and who I aspire to be are not the same at this point. I do not always live by my core personal values so it was a useful exercise to first establish what those values are and then reflect on how much I actually live by those values. Again I feel empowered to live my consciously and intentionally represent the values that are important to me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            3. The final thing I guess I could say I learned about myself was my problem solving methods. I did not already ‘think like a web developer’ before I started this course. Working through the first sprint core taught me a lot about how I have been trying to solve problems. Which is basically charging in blind without intention or a plan. This method does not lend itself to problem solving like a programmer. I tend to be impatient and almost belligerent when I tackle a problem. I’ve always thought I could quickly process information and solve problems quickly. But going through the sprint 1 core I learned a whole bunch of ways to effectively break down a problem and understand it. Then in the technical sprints I learned why these methods are important and useful when I did not understand the questions. I had to go back and revisit sprint 1 and really absorb the techniques of how to think like a programmer.  
        </p>
        <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
        <p>
            As previously mentioned, when you understand that your brain can change then it empowers you to take control of your brains development. In my case, I am someone who is studying computer programming in my mid-thirties. If I was not aware of neuroplasticity I might think that it is too late for someone like me to learn something as complex as computer programming. However, I am aware of neuroplasticity so I am going to use that knowledge to my benefit and practice coding every single day until I have created and strengthened those neural pathways. 
        </p>
        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <h3>Learning</h3>
        <p>
            Values, empathy and self awareness all play different roles in the learning process. My values inform my approach in some ways. Specifically, my core value of curiosity lends itself to leaning and my love of research. In each sprint I found myself doing a lot of reading and research.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Empathy has played a role when I reached out for help from others and when I have provided help to others. For my own learning journey the empathy of others has assisted me when I was stuck on a problem or frustrated. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Self awareness places a crucial role in learning as it allows you to learn with intention. If you are aware of your learning style, your limitations, your proclivity for distraction you are able to put together an effective learning plan by working with the parameters that suit you. Self awareness makes this possible. Self awareness also helps when you are getting frustrated. If you notice your emotions start to take over your brain function you are able to correct your thinking and behaviour to better suit the learning environment.  
        </p>
        <h3>Programming</h3>
        <p>
            I declare and understand my core values so that they may guide my in my life and all that I do. Therefore they are an important part of my programming career. My values will be the pillars from which I build my programming career.  
        </p>     
        <p>
            Programming can serve a lot of purposes and meet many different needs. Having empathy will help a programmer consider people and the communities they server when programming. A good example of this is accessibility in web development. If a programmer is practising empathy and considers the needs of everyone who may possibly use the website they are building then they will go extra lengths to make sure that people of all differing abilities are able to use their website. Empathy will also help you understand others in general which will play an important role when collaboration on code.  
        </p>
        <p>
            Self awareness is useful in just about every context I can think of. Having self awareness plays a role in programming workflow. As I previously mentioned, having self awareness will help someone develop an effective learning plan. The same goes for working. If you have a high level of self awareness then you will effectively plan a workflow that suits you particular strengths and will likely improve your productivity. Self awareness also plays a role in a collaborative workspace. Programming happens to be very collaborative so having a good sense of self awareness  will inform how you work with others. If you can feel yourself getting frustrated when working in a group environment and you are self aware enough to know how to handle your frustration effectively then you are much less likely to cause issues of inhibit productivity within your team.   
        </p>     
        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Learning about and practising growth mindset has been a game changer for me. For so long I was in the fixed mindset camp and believed I was limited by my natural aptitudes. Researching growth mindset and practising it over the last couple weeks has given me a lot of confidence and reduced my stress levels while learning this challenging content. When I hit a wall and feel frustrated by not being able to understand a concept, instead of giving up and thinking I never will be able to learn this, I instead tell myself I just haven’t got it yet. That simple change in mindset has completely changed how I learn and work. I am surprised that such a small shift could have such a large impact.
        </p>
        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            Writing about myself in a personal way is challenging. I find myself feeling self conscious and anxious about how my content will be received by my instructors and colleagues. Writing these blog posts has been challenging for that reason. I end up revising and rewriting a lot. I always feel a twinge of anxiety every time I publish a blog. Getting over that feeling and being more confident in what I write and the content I am pushing out the world has been challenging but also one of the main reasons I am doing this course. I want build the confidence to put myself out there. 
        </p>    
        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think it is quite obvious and you talk about it a lot in your promotional material. Tech firms do not just want people who can write code. They want workers who can work in a collaborative environment and contribute positively to workplace culture.
        </p>    
        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            No, it does not feel like a waste of time. This is a very intensive learning style we are undertaking. If we are not prepared to learn in this way then we will not absorb as much of the programming material. If we had three years to learn programming then sure, maybe we would naturally develop an understand of the core concepts presented over the last 5 weeks. But since we are learning programming in just a few months it makes perfect sense to me that we would be presented with a very intentional and structures curriculum teaching us the skills to get the most out of this program. 
        </p>
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
          My goals have not changed since last time I was asked this question during sprint 2. I am doing this course so that I have a skill that allows me to work anywhere in the world doing a wide variety of things for a wide variety of organisations. I want a trade that provides a stable income but also freedom to move about the world and is flexible enough to be applied to many different kinds of projects. I do not yet know what “work” will look like for me, but I do know that I would love to get a job with a tech company based in NZ, and preferably one with a bend towards ethical and sustainable business.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>
          Well, back in sprint 2 I felt pretty confident that I could learn new skills and understand new concepts quickly. I clearly had never tried to learn JavaScript before! I really struggled to understand (and still do) how to write JS. I always overcomplicated my solutions which clearly means I do not fully grasp how to think like a programmer. I went into this thinking that my biggest strengths would be the ease by which I pick up the skills we are learning. Now going into bootcamp I would say one of my biggest limitations is how little I understand about JS going in and how slowly I’m working my way through this learning. 
        </p>
        <p>
          With this new understanding I would say my strengths now lie in my steadfast determination to do my best. I still think I am a good researcher, but learning these new skills quickly is not going to happen this time. However I am confident that my work ethic and my tremendous interest in the subject will overcome my slow learning and will power me through bootcamp.
        </p>
        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>
          I think stress will be an enormous challenge. I am not working during this experience so investing everything I have into learning how to be a programmer is a pretty big deal for me. I think the pressure of knowing that I absolutely need to get a job as soon as possible after bootcamp, as well as my penchant for self doubt, will cause a fair amount of anxiety over the next 9 weeks. Basically I cannot afford to fail and that will be hanging over me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have a tendency towards distraction. I will be sitting here writing my answers and before I even realise what I am doing I am out on the web researching what is the best laptop to use as a programmer. My mind it always racing and I sometimes struggle to keep it focused on one thing for great lengths of time. 
        </p>
        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
        <p>
          One of the reasons I chose this program was for the non-technical human skill training that was advertised. I have never been confident in public speaking or giving feedback. I really hope to have opportunities to work on and become comfortable with both. I have been a manager for years and while I valued collaboration, I mostly instructed and gave orders. I always found it stressful to give feedback. I do have quite a bit of experience leading a team but I am looking forward to filling different roles at bootcamp and learning how to collaborate and communicate in the context of programming. 
        </p>
        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
          As I said in sprint 2, I hold myself to a high standard and take my education as well as this programme seriously. I am not here to waist my time or anybody else’s. We are all here to facilitate learning whether it be as a student, teacher, or industry professionals. We all share the same goal and I am here to honour that goal by doing the work, on time, to the best of my ability, and to support my colleagues to do the same. I will seek help from my colleagues as well as the course facilitators whether it be in person or on the slack channel. I have also learned a bit about how to find help online using various resources like w3schools and stack overflow. With the help of the internet and everyone on the EDA journey I know that I can be successful.
